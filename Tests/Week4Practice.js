/*
1. Create a class called Cubic representing cubic shapes. The constructor should accept 
length, width, height. Write methods on the class to return the surface area and the volume 
of the object. Write a function outside of the class that accepts an array of Cubic that 
outputs the number of objects, total surface area, and total volume to the screen.
*/


/*
2. Create a class that wraps an array inside of it. The constructor arguments should be the 
lower and upper bounds of the index. i.e. this array's bounds can go negative. Implement 
methods get(index) and set(index, value) that get and set the value at the index.
*/


/*
3. Create a class that implements your FizzBuzz lab logic via iterators. The constructor 
should take arguments of the min and max value to iterate through; the iterator should only 
produce values of "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz". Values should not be generated for numbers 
that don't produce any of those values; they should be skipped. Use generators if possible
